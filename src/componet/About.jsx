                        Hi, I'm Preeti Diwakar, a frontend developer from Kanpur. I have a strong foundation in web development, with technical skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, along with basic knowledge of Python and C programming. I hold a Software Engineering Diploma from Navgurukul and have experience building user-friendly web applications. My passion lies in solving complex problems, continuously learning new technologies, and working on innovative projects that make a difference. Outside of work, I find joy in cooking and engaging in creative activities that fuel my inspiration. I am eager to join a dynamic team where I can continue to grow, contribute, and make a positive impact.
